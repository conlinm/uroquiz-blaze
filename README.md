##Welcome to Uroquiz##

This is an app built using meteor. It makes use of study questions for the urology inservice exam, and because of this, the app is not for public use, but the structure and function can be used if you find any of it helpful. I change my environment variable for mongo to hook it up to the questions collection in a separate mongodb. 

###Current packages:###
* remove autopublish
* add bootstrap-3
* add accounts-ui-bootstrap-3
* add accounts-password
* add accounts-google
* add accounts-facebook
* add spin
* add iron-router
* add jquery
